kakuro-solver
=============

A Windows program for automatically solving Kakuro (also known as Cross Sum) puzzles. No documentation, but you'll figure it out if you know the puzzle. Solves most large puzzles (22x13) in a few seconds. Requires .NET Framework 2.0 or higher.

The program was written in C# using [Visual Studio Express 2005](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) (yes, this was a long time ago).
